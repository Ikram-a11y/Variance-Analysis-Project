This project applies ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) to a dataset of diamonds to explore the relationship between various categorical features (such as cut, color, and clarity) and the price of diamonds. The goal is to determine whether the different categories within these features have a statistically significant effect on the diamond prices.

Key Features


* One-Way ANOVA: Analyzes the effect of a single categorical feature  on the price.

* Two-Way ANOVA: Examines the combined effect of two features  on price.

* Post-Hoc Analysis: Performed to identify which specific groups differ significantly from each other when the ANOVA results indicate significant differences.

Steps Involved

1- Data Exploration: Initial exploration and visualization of the dataset to understand the distribution of price across different categories.
2- ANOVA Analysis: Implementation of ANOVA to test for significant differences in mean prices across different categories.
3- Post-Hoc Testing: Additional testing to pinpoint the specific categories that differ.
4- Visualization: Graphical representation of results to provide a clear understanding of how different features affect diamond prices.
